# Assignment 2 - still in progress

The frontend and backend have been implemented completely. However, I am yet to use/configure passport.js.

Note to TA: I am doing my project alone, so it will be great if you can grade my project after grading all team projects.
Thank you so much for your understanding.

## Backend

The server has been built using node.js and express.js. It has end points right now primarily for signin, signup.

### `npm start` starts the server

cd into the backend folder and type 'npm start'. This will start the server.
Please start the server before starting the frontend.
Keep this open in one terminal window.

## Frontend

The frontend has been built using React.js.

### `npm start` starts the react scripts

cd into the frontend folder and type 'npm start'. This starts the react scripts and runs the app in development mode.
The server runs on port 3000. Since react defaults to port 3000, it will ask if it is okay to run in a different port, please say yes or type 'y' when prompted in the terminal. This will run it on port 3001.
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.
