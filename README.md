# Assignment 2 - still in progress

The frontend and backend have been implemented completely. However, I am yet to use/configure passport.js.
Note to TA: I am doing my project alone, so it will be great if you can grade my project after grading all team projects.
Thank you so much for your understanding.

## Backend

The server has been built using node.js and express.js. It has end points right now primarily for signin, signup.

### `npm start` starts the server

cd into the backend folder and type 'npm start'. This will start the server.
Please start the server before starting the frontend.
Keep this open in one terminal window.

## Frontend

The frontend has been built using React.js.

### `npm start` starts the react scripts

cd into the frontend folder and type 'npm start'. This starts the react scripts and runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
